# Inspire-Page-using-traditional-layout
I created a web page using only traditional layouts in css.
## Layout used
Float left and float right only.
## Is it useful and reliable to always use?
Very manual, but important to learn the basics. Not reliable in more complex layouts as it takes time, but very important to learn everything from scratch.
Helps you understand the other complex layout attributes, grid and flexbox.
##What did I learn?
I learned how to control every element by its own and adjust its position manually and solely. This built my background knowledge about how every element in the page moves and where.
